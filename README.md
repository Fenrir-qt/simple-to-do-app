# Simple To-Do List Web App

A simple, interactive, and responsive web application for a to-do list that was created with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Tasks can be added, edited, and deleted with this application, which uses the browser's **localStorage** for persistent storage.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks to the list by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add" button or pressing the "Enter" key.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can edit existing tasks by clicking the "Edit" button.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the "Delete" button.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage, so they remain even after refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is styled using **CSS** and is fully responsive for different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web app.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout, including responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and functionality (adding, editing, deleting tasks, and localStorage integration).
- **Bootstrap**: For additional styling and icons.

## How It Works

1. **Adding a Task**:
   - Type a task in the input field.
   - Press the "Add" button or hit the "Enter" key to add the task to the list.

2. **Editing a Task**:
   - Click the "Edit" button next to a task.
   - A prompt will appear allowing you to modify the task.
   - The task will be updated in the list and saved in localStorage.

3. **Deleting a Task**:
   - Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
   - The task will also be removed from localStorage.

4. **Persistent Storage**:
